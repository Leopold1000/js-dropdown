# js-dropdown
A Javascript and css file for an easy dropdown for your html webpage

## How to use
Create a div with class "dropdown-parent" and two child divs. One of the child divs should have class "dropdown-head" and the other one should have class "dropdown-content".
### dropdown-head
Inside the dropdown-head div you can put anything you want to be shown in the dropdown bar.
### dropdown-content
Inside the dropdown-content div you can put whatever you want to be seen after the bar is clicked. If you need the "display" style attribute to be different than "block" you can create another div with your chosen display style.
